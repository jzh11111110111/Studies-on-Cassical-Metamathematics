# Studies-on-Cassical-Metamathematics
I will present my study on classical metamathematics here, including set theory, structural proof theory, recursion theory, formal arithmetic, and other relvant research by GÃ¶del and Tarski. I don't act as the researcher in these fields in public, but this research is closely related to mine.
